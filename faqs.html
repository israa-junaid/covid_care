                                    Isolation is when a person who is experiencing infectious diseases such as COVID-19 symptoms
                                    stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places.
                                    This can be voluntarily or based on his/her doctor’s recommendation.

                                    Quarantine means restricting activities or separating people who are not ill themselves 
                                    but may have been exposed to COVID-19. 
                                    The goal is to prevent spread of the disease at the time when people just develop symptoms..

                                    COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.
                                     This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, 
                                    in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally.

                                <p>
                                    Social distancing means being physically apart. 
                                    WHO recommends keeping at least 6 feet distance from others.
                                    This is a general measure that everyone should take even if they are well
                                    with no known exposure to COVID-19. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The time between exposure to COVID-19 and the moment when symptoms start
                                     is commonly around five to six days but can range from 1 – 14 days.

                                <p>
                                    Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 
                                    72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours
                                    on cardboard.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Are antibiotics a means of treating COVID-19?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. 
                                    COVID-19 is caused by a virus, 
                                    so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of 
                                    prevention or treatment of COVID-19.
